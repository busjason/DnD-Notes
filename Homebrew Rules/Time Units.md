# Moments

A moment is a time abstraction rule. It is an undefined period of time of activity. Moments are longer than a combat and are not a defined period of time like a minute, hour, or day.

Moments can be used to trigger actions for the characters. Generally 5 consecutive moments could be used to cause a triggering action.

When a party is not in combat and one of its members takes an action that will take some undetermined amount of time. The party is using a moment. The DM should track these with a 1d6. When the party reaches 5 moments without a long rest they roll the accumulated dice and if there is a 1 there is a complication.

When a party takes a long rest they get all the benefits of a long rest as detailed in the player's handbook except they only recover 1 Hit Die of HP and 1 Hit Die per moment they consumed.

The result of the complication should be themed around the location and situation the party is in. 
 
## Actions during a moment

#### Travel
You could break down overland travel into moments and allow for an exploration survival adventure to be played at a larger time scale. 

#### Exploration / Skills
Exploration and Skills that take some time to perform such as tracking, survival, picking a lock, performing, will consume a whole moment. 

#### Short Rest
An adventuring party can take a short rest during a moment. 

#### Casting a spell
A caster can generally cast only one ritual spell or extended spell during a moment.

For the purposes of healing or utility outside of combat there is not really a set limit to the number of single action/bonus action/reaction spells a character could cast in a moment. However, since some players will push this limit for the sake laying out the rules no more than 22 spells including cantrips can be cast.
