# Moments

### The Rules

Moments are a time abstraction contruct with supporting rules. A Moment is meant to represent a handful of undefined periods of time of adventuring activity for the PC party contained within a defined time period. It is important to understand that moments themselves are not a defined period of time like a round of combat or a minute, hour, or day. The DM determines the scope and number of moments for a given scene. For the sake of standardization generally scenes should be split into 5 moments. The moments are represented by 6 sided dice that the party controls. When a player wants to perform an action that would take a moment to accomplish the DM would let them know that the action requires a moment and the players determine if they want to use a die. If they do each player can choose what they would like to use the moment for. The party then has a choice they can roll the moment die or discard it. If they choose to roll the moment die it is rolled and a roll of a 1 means there is a complication during the moment. Otherwise it is set aside into the recovery pool. When the players feel they need a long rest they roll the recovery pool if there are any 1s they have a complication and depending on how they respond they may or may not be interrupted during the long rest. Once they have successfully finished a long rest they recover as they would during the rest except for HP and Hit Dice. They recover 1 HD of HP (as if rolling HD for a short rest) and 1 HD for each dice in the recovery pool. At minimum if no actions are taken the party recovers 1 HD of HP and 1 HD for a long rest.

## Examples

#### Exploration / Skills
Exploration and Skills that take some time to perform such as tracking, survival, picking a lock, performing, will consume a whole moment. 

#### Short Rest
An adventuring party can take a short rest during a moment. 

#### Casting a spell
A caster can generally cast only one ritual spell or extended spell during a moment. 

To translate spell casting times to moments

Casting Time | Moments
-------------|-----------
1 Action | -
1 Bonus Action | -
1 Reaction | -
1 Min | 1
10 Min | 1
1 Hour | 1 
More | 5

For the purposes of healing or utility outside of combat there is not really a set limit to the number of single action/bonus action/reaction spells a character could cast in a moment. However, since some players will push this limit for the sake laying out the rules no more than 22 spells including cantrips can be cast. 

#### Travel
You could break down overland travel into moments and allow for an exploration survival adventure to be played at a larger time scale.

## What is the problem it is trying to solve?

In current play of Dungeons & Dragons time is usually denoted in concrete terms, though in the case of combat rounds they are more abstracted. However, even then, it is usually noted that a round is equivelant to 6 seconds. These concrete definitions can be problematic for various reasons. 

1. First, anybody who has ever tried to keep track of time in a D&D game knows that to say it is difficult for a DM is a gross understatement. Due to this "difficulty" it is usually handwaved and ignored meaning there is really no difference between a spell that takes 10 min to cast versus one that takes 2 hours, or 24 hours. Yes of course these things can be noted in the story but there isn't really any rules about it other than that's how long it takes. 
1. Second, how long does it take to pick a complicated lock or search a messy room? What about tidying that messy room? Does it matter how long it takes? What if as the DM a player is trying to pick the lock on the door out of the room and another wants to search the room. You say sure your player it's going to take you 5 min to pick that lock, because again who knows. And your player looks you dead in the eye pushes their glasses up their noes and says, "Well actually, it takes only about 10-15 seconds for a simple lock." I mean why does anybody care that a short rest and any "bring a player back from the dead" other than revivify takes exactly one hour? Or, that casting Contingency takes 10 minutes? I mean are you keeping track of that anyway. So we should think about removing concrete time intervals for game mechanics we could use something like a moment.
1. Third, Even if we were keeping track of every minute every day there are still 16 hours in an active D&D character's day that is 960 active D&D mintues. Why does it matter!!! Then again who am I kidding we all know your party's work day is only 5 minutes. (However, The moment rules might help address this too.) Time currently in the game isn't really a consideration it isn't really a resource to be used in any productive way. It is essentially infinite and if your players decide to ignore it and you the DM start getting too uppity and doing things like giving timed missions, locking them in places "too dangerous" to rest or god forbid interrupting their rests they get all sad and the game's not fun, and you're being mean. So I'd like to see the rules give options to the players in interesting ways time should be useful and fun.
1. Fourth, as it is now the only threat to a D&D party is combat. Combat is the strongest pillar in D&D and that is great let it stand but why aren't there resources to use other than HP and spell slots. Even gold without the concept of time loses its meaning in a lot of ways. In the real world time is the great enemy we only have so much and it is always marching along every minute wasted is a minute lost. Can we translate some of that feeling into our games?

Now I'm not saying we should be aiming for perfect realism I mean we do have dragons and dungeons after all. Our PCs should be worried about finishing the adventure so they can make it back for their day job as an accounts clerk. I'm just saying time should be more like a resource to use to make decisions within the game. So based on the problems we are trying to solve our rules should make time easier to track, reduce the reliance for concrete time intervals, give the players something to do with time, and make time more of a threat. Oh and as a bonus if we get around to it solve once and for all the the problem of the 5 min work day, or at the very least not make it worse. So where do we start?

## What is a moment?

We should define a moment. A moment should be a limited resource given to the party to use. The moments are limited arbitrary time blocks within a certain defined time period. The scope of the defined time period should be determined before the moments are given. For example a party is infiltrating a bandit camp while the majority of bandits are out pillaging They only have until dusk before the raiding groups return. You the DM can then give them some number of moments, lets say 5 and thats it. We don't really know or care how long the moments are they are just an abstract view of the time the players have to do what they came here to do. When they use those 5 moments the raiding groups come back to camp and the party has to deal with that. 

## What can you do in a moment?

Another example could be exploring an old dungeon there is no time pressure per say so we give them 5 moments between morning and mid day and and 5 between midday and night. This structures the day and gives some meaning to the time they are using. So what constitutes a moment what can players do with a moment. The first things that come to my mind are combat, resting, and spell casting. So lets just say combat is insignificant. In D&D time combat is usually resolved in seconds so we just use rounds as defined in the book and ignore combat or really any action that could be done in combat so action, bonus action, reaction abilities and spells. A short rest is 1 moment done easy. I'd say in our example of the dungeon anything that takes minutes uses up a moment. Searching a room, tracking and following a quarry, picking a lock, solving a puzzle, disarming/setting a trap, reading a book, casting a ritul or long casting time spell, etc. Something to keep in mind is each player should be able to use the moment for different tasks if they want to. That just made me think of helping if a character wants to help another to give them advantage well now this means there is one less thing the party can do during the moment options and tradeoffs. I like that.

So at this point we've abstracted time to combat pedantry given the party a limited resource to use we've given the added the threat of triggered actions based on the exaustion of the moment resource, and we've made it easier to track because first I'm giving it to the players to track and I've reduced the number of things from 16 hours/960 minutes to like 2 sets of 5 moments. Done and done. However I think there is more we could do here. to ratchet up the tension, and improve the ease of tracking. 

## Is there anything else?

To combat confusion lets just say in general we use 5 consecutive moments to trigger some defined time. This just defines the rules a little bit and keeps things consistent. Let's use dice to keep track of these (It should be note I have read The Angry GM's (Scott Rehm) article Hacking Time in D&D and these thoughts expanded off of the ideas in his article.) Give the players 5 d6s this represents their pool of time resources. (Their time pool, ok!) When a player wants to do something that takes time you should say that requires you to take a moment. The party determines if they want to use the moment resource if they do then they each discuss what they want to do during the moment. The party may return the die to you the DM or optionally roll the die and if it is a 1 there is some kind of complication during the moment, then set aside the die. When all of the moments have been used. Record time if desired and refill the time pool. Now here is where the biggest change comes in and it has to do with adding threat to time. The long rest. When a party choses to take a long rest they get all the value of a long rest except they only get 1 hit die and 1 hitdie of HP for each rolled moment die. The decision to roll the moment die can only be made when it is used. this means that if a party decides to avoid complications or take a rest early they recover fewer hit dice and hp.
