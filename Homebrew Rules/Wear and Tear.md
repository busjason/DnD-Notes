# Wear and Tear

### Wear and Tear Rules
When a character rolls a 1 or an opponent rolls a 20 on any d20 roll involving some physical action the player takes a point of wear on an item they are using during that action. When an item reaches 3 wear points it is destroyed. When a point of wear is added to the item it is temporary until another wear is added to the item at which point the previous wear becomes permanent. A temporary wear may be removed by using a short rest to repair an item instead of getting the benefits of the short rest. If you are using the moment rules you can perform the repair action during a moment. To repair a permanent wear the player must have proficiency in the proper tools to perform the repair and be in a period of down time it costs half the cost of the item new. For magic items you can use the median price of the magic item rarity in the DMG as the cost of the item. Items made of rarer materials like mithril or adamantium could be less likely to be destroyed from wear with more wear points on the item. However it would cost significantly more to repair them.

## Questions

### Does that mean magic items can be destroyed?
Yes. in my opinions magic items should require maintenance unless their magic specifically protects them such as armor of gleaming from Xanathar's guide. More powerful magic items could have more wear points if desired.

### What does that mean for natural weapons?
Natural weapons have to be maintained as well. Animals are found with broken tusks, horns, teeth, and claws. Monks must maintain their wraps and bones. The cost to repair these should be far less perhaps just increased time to remove the permanent wear. Breaking is possible and I'd even suggest monks who don't maintain their martial attacks would possibly suffer from broken bones that prevent the use of their martial arts bonus attacks.

### Does this affect spell casting?
Yes spell component pouches, arcane and divine focuses are used to control powerful effects they can be damaged by their misuse as well. 

### Can I repair a destroyed item?
Yes. A destroyed item is unusable while it is destoryed and takes two times the cost of the item to repair it. For items made of rare or unique materials it may require the player to go on an adventure to find the required materials. 

## Examples

- A rogue is using their thieves' tools to attempt to pick the lock on a chest. They roll and get a natural 1 they fail the attempt and add one wear to their thieves tools. Its no big deal they can fix that a little later. However, upon opening the chest the mimic springs to action and a combat begins the rogue is unlucky and the dice are not in their favor the Mimic critically hits the rogue on the first attack and the rogue has to add wear to their leather armor. Bleeding and flustered the rogue strikes back with the dagger but the mimic is too fast the rogue rolls another one this time adding wear to their dagger as theys strike the blade against the floor. After the fight the party decide to take a short rest the rogue now has some options they can take the rest and heal from the critical strike and any other wounds. Perhaps the rogue used uncanny dodge and doesn't really need the HP right now and decides to repair an item. Their dagger is magical and repairing permanent damage is expensive so they choose to repair the temporary damage to the dagger during the rest. In the next combat an opponent gets a 20 while trying to grapple the rogue and they get another damage on their leather armor. Now it has one permanent and one temporary wear another critical strike will destroy the armor and require more money to replace or repair. 

- The party comes across an old rope bridge it is worn and looks dangerous to cross. Essentially the bridge has two permanent wear points. The party can spend significant time and money to repair the bridge or they can attempt to cross as it is. The bridge is unstable and requires a athletics or acrobatics check to cross. If one of the characters rolls a 1 the bridge collapses and the party plummets down the ravine.
