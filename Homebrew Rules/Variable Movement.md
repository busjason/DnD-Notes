# Variable Movement

## Rule

Base movement speed for all creatures is 15 feet. Standing up from prone takes 15 ft. of movement. If a creature wants to move farther than their base movement speed they roll their movement die and move 5 x the result feet. 

|Movement Die|Movement Min|Movement Median|Movement Max|
|---|---|---|---|
|1d6|20 ft.|30 ft.|45 ft.|
|2d6|25 ft.|50 ft.|75 ft.|
|3d6|30 ft.|65 ft.|105 ft.|
|4d6|35 ft.|85 ft.|135 ft.|
|5d6|40 ft.|100 ft.|165 ft.|

## Examples

## Why

- Movement as it is in D&D is deterministic and this is boring and bad.
- There is currently little to no tactical benefit to moving in D&D. Because of the previous point.
- The prone condition does not even begin to represent the treat of being knocked down in combat. 

## Considerations
- Movement distances should be variable.
- Creatures should not be prevented from moving by these rules.
- Variable movement rules should address the weaknesses of the current prone rules.
- It should be reasonably possible for a creature to move out of range of an attacker and the attacker not necessarily be able to catch up.
- Creatures with higher movment speed should still be more mobile on average then creatures with low movement speed. 
- Moving farther than base movement speed can and possibly should be possible. 
- Does this affect combat speed too much?
