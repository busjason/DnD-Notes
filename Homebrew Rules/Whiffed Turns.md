# Whiffed Turns

## Rules

The wiffed turn rules give a player whose turn was ineffectual a reaction they can trigger on somebody elses turn. A player may take on of the following features during character creation / or when these rules are introduced. Each feature gives the player a reaction ability when they attempt an action that is ineffectual or choses to do nothing on their turn. The reaction ability is then triggered off an action of another creatures' action.

1. Trip - When a creature moves within 5 feet of you that creature falls prone.
1. Distraction - When a creature within 30 feet of you casts a spell you may force them to subtract your charisma modifier from their spell attack mod or spell save DC.
1. Coordination - When a creature attacks another creature within 5 feet of you add your strength or dex modifier to their attack.
1. Defend - When a creature within 5 feet of you is attacked you may add your con modifier to their AC.
1. Grab - When a creature moves within 5 feet of you that creature is grappled.
1. Insightfulness - When a creature within 30 feet of you is missed by an attack you can grant them your wisdom modifier temporary HP
1. Brilliance - When a creature within 30 feet of you casts a spell you can add you intelligence modifier to the damage. 

## Examples



## Why

- A lost turn is not fun.
- The risk of losing an action to try something unconventional is often too much of a cost.
- Players who fail on a turn sometimes lose connection to the game especially if it happens more than once. 

## Considerations

- I want the players to feel they have something to contribute even if they missed their attack.
- I want players to have choices that are not just attack.
- The reaction should not involve an extra roll or action on the part of the reacting player it should modify somebody elses action not interrupt it.
- The reacting player should have to pay attention to what others are doing to watch out for the triggering event so they maintain investment in the combat.
- The reactions should be meaningful and interesting.
- The reactions should have times when it might be better to trigger them then a normal action but this should not be the norm.
