### History
> The Demon Lord Turaglas the Ravenous, weakened from a defeat, escaped avernus through a stray portal to a prime material plane after a failed demonic incursion. Withered, weakened, and starved the demon now little more than a wisp sought a source of power to feed his unending hunger. He could feel a surge pulsing from the frayed end of a ley-line of the weave. Turaglas' essence laid in wait for a soul to possess and feed upon. 
> 
> The unfortunate soul destined to carry the Demon Lord was a powerful warrior, a son of Gruumsh, An Orc warrior named Maknnok. The Orcish warrior used the power from the demon to rise in ranks to tribal chieftain and Turaglas fed upon the Orc's soul. The endless feasting of Turaglas left Maknok's soul ragged, and restless.
>
> Maknok's insanity progressed rapidly he ranted and wailed about the human village below. The tribe's orcish priests saw the growing recklessness of Maknok and his ramblings as a sign from Gruumsh to move the tribe into the settlement in the hills.  They descended the mountain to claim the village and slay its inhabitants.
>
> The Orcs attacked but were defeated by a group of adventurers and a cadre of soldiers from the nearby city of Neverwinter. Turaglas strengthened from his orcish feast fled the orc as he was struck down and fled toward the source of power he had been hunting. He found it deep in a mining cavern the humans had recently been rebuilding. Inside the cavern an ancient brazier burned with arcane fire. Turaglas latched hold and began consuming the raw power growing as he feasted. 
>
> In the weeks that followed Turaglas feasted only stopping to belch out demonic beasts born in his fetid bowels. The same group of adventurers came to stop his feast but he pushed them back eating one in the process. He now had full control of the arcane font and ate trying to assuage his ravenous hunger. As he ate he grew and as he grew he ate. Now his fleshy form fills the caverns...

### 1. The Mouth of the Abyss

> Before you in the side of the rocky cliff the familiar cleft in the rock leads you to the cavern mouth you are looking for. The first thing you notice is the warm humid air flowing out of the cavern. The smell is overwhelming. The air pungent with a sour acidity that calls to mind the taste of bile in the back of your throat, rotting meat, and curdled milk all at the same time. The light that makes it through the trees around you fails to illuminate the interior of the cave.
>
>As your eyes adjust to the darkness you can make out rows of ridges that line the walls the ceiling and the floor. Some rise in sharp points others are just long stony ridges. Moisture collects along the ridges and drips down to the floor which is soft and damp.

 
CON SAVE **DC 15** 
-or- 
WIS SAVE **DC 16** 

To save from succumbing to the nausea. On a failure the character is poisoned. 

A poisoned character may make another attempt to save after a rest or a stated attempt to overcome the nausea. If they succeed they are no longer poisoned otherwise they are poisoned until they are no longer in contact with the air. Until they long rest away from the fetid air they are considered to have not had any food or water that day for the purposes of removing exhaustion.

Magic means to remove the poisoning work only if used before the second attempt. After the poisoning is only abated for a single turn.

### 2. Into the Bowels of Evil

> As you move into the cavern the floor is soft and saturated with moisture. You find the terrain difficult to traverse. All of a sudden you hear a sound like muffled voices booming around you. It cries out in as if with a thousand mouths. Screams, moans, yelling, and speaking. Each voice adding another insane layer to the cacophony around you.  The ridges below you rumble the cavern shifts the entrance snaps shut and the walls collapse around you. 

CON Save **DC 16** 

Take 8d10 bludgeoning damage. Half on a successful save.

Small Creatures - Advantage on the saving throw and if you succeed you take no damage.

Medium Creatures - No effect.

Large Creature - Disadvantage on the saving throw and you are vulnerable to the damage.
 
 ### 3. The Belly of the Beast

 > You struggle against the crushing weight as your mind reels under the pressure of so many voices. You feel yourself being pushed deeper into the inky blackness. All around you the world is in commotion the ridges grind against you the voices continue to wail. After a short moment that felt eternal you fall with a splash into a pool of acrid slime. The air around you is stifling your you body aches and your ears and head are pounding from the overwhelming sensations. No its not in you it is all around you the pounding like a heartbeat. You begin to itch. 

With a concerted effort the party can make a hole in the stomach. The check should depend on the action.

**DC 17**
 
 Each attempt takes a [time unit](../../Homebrew Rules/Time Units.md). 

For each time unit in the Belly

CON Save **DC 12** + **2** * **Time Units** : 
Take 2d6 acid damage cumulatively

WIS Save **DC 10** + **2** * **Time Units** : 

### 4. Attacking the Heart 
> You squeeze through the hole you have cut through the creatures stomach lining the pounding of the heart and the screaming insanity in your ears grows louder. You see the viscera of some foul beast all around you. Looking up you see the its heart pounding rhythmically. Its organs shifting with each of its breaths around you. You must still the pounding heart!

The space inside is hard to navigate. Any vertical movement is difficult terrain. Any ground movment calls for a successful Dex check **DC 15** failure by 5 or more causes the mover to slip and fall.
